This worked for me your mileage may vary.
1.Connect to SCCM Database with SQL server management studio
2. Run "SQLQuerrytogetDeploymentInfo" to return existing application information
3. Save the results as CSV. Sometimes the column headers won't export so you may need to add them. 
4. In the CSV find and replace all "LocalSystem<" with "<"and "MSISystem{" with "{" 
(I'm positive there's a way to modify the querry to not return that as part of the data, but I'm bad at SQL"
5.If there are applications you do not wish to migrate remove them from your CSV.
6.Run the CopyAppContenttoLocation script.
7.Run the PackageApps script
8.Run WriteDetectionMethodsandProductCodesCommandstoAppFolders
9.Run WriteDetectionMethodType
10.Run Iterate through each package folder extract registry detection and file detection info from xml
11.Run UploadScript.
